# take-note
Take Note is a webapp that stores notes on your browser, for as long as you need them there.
The notes are stored in local storage so you have access to them as long as you're using that browser.

## How It Works
1. Go to [Take Note](https://jemimaabu.github.io/take-note).
2. Add a note.
3. That's it. The note is stored in your browser for as long as you need it.

Because the notes are stored in your browser, you're the only one that has access to them. There are no servers or databases involved so nothing is stored online.

Anytime you visit [Take Note](https://jemimaabu.github.io/take-note), your notes will be displayed to you.

## Offline Version
- Clone the git repo to a folder on your laptop.
- Open up the index.html file in any browser and bookmark the page.
- You now have a locally stored note app on your browser.
